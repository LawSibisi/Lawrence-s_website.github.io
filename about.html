            <h3>Hello! I'm Lawrence Sibisi, a passionate Junior DevOps Engineer and aspiring<br> software developer from Orange Farm, South Africa. My journey into the tech<br> world began with a fascination for how systems operate behind the scenes.<br>
            <br>
            As a DevOps engineer, I’ve embraced the command line, leveraging Linux to streamline<br> processes and enhance collaboration between development and operations teams.<br> I thrive in dynamic environments, where I can apply my skills in automation and cloud technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, I’m focused on expanding my programming knowledge and refining<br> my development skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning.<br> My goal is to bridge the gap between infrastructure and software development,<br> creating efficient and scalable solutions.<br>
            <br>
            Join me as I continue this exciting journey into the world of technology!
